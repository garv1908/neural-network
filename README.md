# Learning to write a neural network that recognizes hand-written digits!

This is a humble adventure to venture out into the world of machine-learning. I've heavily commented the code, mostly for my own understanding of the concepts, but feel free to run the [nn.py](./nn.py) file and check out how the program performs yourself! It goes through 3 epochs, or iterations, training itself on the MNIST dataset included in `/data`.
